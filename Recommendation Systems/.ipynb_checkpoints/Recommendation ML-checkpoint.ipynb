    "### What is a Recommendation System? \n",
    "A recommendation systems works to filter data using different algorithms to recommend the most relevant items to users. Often, it first captures the past behavior of a customer and then recommends things based on that past behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Flow of a Recommendation System:\n",
    "1. Collect the data from the customer in the form of ratings.\n",
    "2. Comment and store data in a standard database.\n",
    "3. Filter the data to extract the relevant meaningful information required.\n",
    "4. Predict the final recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data and Data Collection\n",
    "The data used in a reccommendation system can take many forms. Possible data could relate to customer behavior, interests, browsing history, and even their similarity with another likely customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data can be collected explicitly and/or implicitly. **Explicit data** is information that is provided intentionally. This includes any form of input from the users, such as the contribution of movie ratings. **Implicit data** is information that is not provided intentionally but gathered from available data streams. This includes things like search history, clicks, order history, etc.\n"

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering is often based on the description of the product or the keywords used to specify more about the product. This filtering technique studies a user’s preferred choices and then delivers the most relevant recommendations. Essentially, based on what we like, the algorithm will simply reccomend similar items.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major drawback of this algorithm is that it is limited to recommending items that are of the same type. It will never recommend products which the user has not bought or liked in the past. So if a user has watched or liked only action movies in the past, the system will recommend only action movies. In this respect, this method is a very narrow way of building an engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to measure similarity, and this is a major decision point in this approach. Common methods include Euclidean Distance, Cosine Similarity, and Pearson's Correlation, with Cosine Similarity probably being the most popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean Distance\n",
    "This is the distance \"as the crow flies\" or the straight line between two points. \n",
    "\n",
    "![EuclideanDisPic.png](assets/EuclideanDisPic.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosine Similarity\n",
    "Cosine similarity works to quantify the relationship between two vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose A and B are 2 movie vectors, A = profile vector and B = item vector, then the similarity between them can be calculated as:\n",

    "![CosSimEq.png](assets/CosSimEq.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the cosine similarity values, which range between -1 to 1, the movies would be arranged in descending order and deliver the top-most recommendations to the user. If the value is near 1 it would have a strong positive relationship, if the value is near -1 then it would have a strong negative relationship, and if the value is close to 0, there would be no relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "![CosSimPic2.png](assets/CosSimPic2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main drawback of this technique is that it recommends movies in the same genre only. If we want recommendations from another movie genre then it might not perform well.\n",

    "### Pearson's Correlation\n",
    "Pearson’s Correlation can tell us the extent to which two items are correlated. A higher correlation would indicate greater similarity. \n",

    "Collaborative filtering techniques usually work with user’s preferences, activities, and behavior. They give recommendations to the user based on similarity with the other likely users. For the collaborative filtering techniques we don’t need any additional information just need to collect and analyze user’s behavior. Thus, this is one of the most commonly used algorithms in the industry as it is not dependent on any additional information. There are different types of collaborating filtering techniques and we shall look at them in detail below."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm first determines the similarity between the users. Based on the similarity score, it identifies the most similar users and recommends products which these similar users have liked or bought previously. Users having a higher similarity score will tend to be recommended similar things. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, this algorithm could work to find the similarity between each user based on the ratings they have previously given to different movies. The prediction of an item for a user u is calculated by computing the weighted sum of the user ratings given by other users to an item i.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction Pu,i is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "![UUCollabPic.png](assets/UUCollabPic.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "With this, \n",
    " - Pu,i is the prediction of an item\n",
    " - Rv,i is the rating given by a user v to a movie i\n",
    " - Su,v is the similarity between users\n",
    "\n",

    "The followings steps are taken to then get that final recommendation:\n",
    "1. First, to calculate the similarity between the user u and v, we can make use of Pearson correlations.\n",
    "2. We can then find the items rated by both the users and, using those ratings, we can calculate the correlation between the users.\n",
    "3. The predictions can then be calculated using these similarity values. The algorithm calculates the similarity between each user and then based on each similarity calculates the predictions. With this, the assumption is that users who have a high correlation will tend to be similar.\n",
    "4. Based on the prediction values, recommendations can made.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "![UUMatrix.png](assets/UUMatrix.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have a user movie rating matrix, with each user represented with each row, and different movies represented in each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, let’s find the similarity between users (A, C) and (B, C) in the above table using Pearson’s correlation. Common movies rated by A and C are movies x2 and x4 and by B and C are movies x2, x4 and x5.\n",
    "\n",
    "![UUCorr.png](assets/UUCorr.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between user A and C is more than the correlation between B and C. Therefore, users A and C have more similarity and the movies liked by user A will be recommended to user C and vice versa.\n",

    "As a warning, this algorithm can be computationally intensive as it involves calculating the similarity for each user and then calculating prediction for each similarity score. This technique is only really usable when there is a low or moderate data size. \n",
    "\n",
    "One way of handling this problem is to select only a few users (neighbors) instead of all to make predictions, i.e. instead of making predictions for all similarity values, we choose only few similarity values. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to select neighbors:\n",
    " - Select a threshold similarity and choose all the users above that value\n",
    " - Randomly select the users\n",
    " - Arrange the neighbors in descending order of their similarity value and choose top-N users\n",

    "---\n",

    "This technique is very similar to the user-user collaborative technique, but instead of finding similarities between users it focuses on the similarity score between items. This approach is effective when the number of users is more than the items being recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "![IICollabPic.png](assets/IICollabPic.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "With the above example in mind, this approach would find the similarity between each movie pair and based on that, it will recommend similar movies which are liked by the users in the past. This algorithm works similar to user-user collaborative filtering with just a slight modification — instead of utilizing the weighted sum of ratings of “user-neighbors”, it utilizes the weighted sum of ratings of “item-neighbors”. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now, with the similarity between each movie and their ratings, predictions can made and based on those metrics, and similar movies can be recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example\n",
    "![IIMatrix.png](assets/IIMatrix.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "Here the mean item rating is the average of all the ratings given to a particular item. Instead of finding the user-user similarity, we will work to find the item-item similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we would first find users who have rated our items of interest, and based on those ratings, the similarity between the items would be calculated. To find the similarity between movies (x1, x4) and (x1, x5). we would look at the common users who have rated movies x1 and x4, as well as the common users who have rated movies x1 and x5. These are users A and B.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before going further and implementing these concepts, there is a question which we must know the answer to — what will happen if a new user or a new item is added in the dataset? This is called a **Cold Start**. \n",

    "There are two main types of cold start:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visitor Cold Start\n",
    "Visitor Cold Start refers to the situation when a new user is introduced in the dataset. Since there is no history of that user, the system does not know the preferences of that user, and it becomes harder to recommend products to that user. \n",
    "\n",
    "One basic approach to resolve this challenge is to apply a popularity based strategy, where the most popular products would be recommended. These can be determined by what has been popular recently, overall, or even regionally. Once we know the preferences of that user, recommending products will become more feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Product Cold Start\n",
    "Product Cold Start refers to the situation when a new product is launched on the market or added to the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "User action is most important to determine the value of any product. The more interaction a product receives, the easier it is for the model to recommend that product to the right user. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can make use of Content-based filtering to resolve this problem. The system would first use the content of the new product for recommendations and then eventually the user actions on that product. But, to be clear, there would be some wait in order to get the intial user interaction data. "

    "Overall, this workshop has introduced you to some common approaches to bulding a recommendation system in Python. There are many other ways to build a recommendation system including K-Nearest Neieghbors, Clusteirng Algorithms, and even Classification approaches. There is so much more to learn here, but the hope is that this case will introduce you to some major concepts, and give you some code to start your journey. "
