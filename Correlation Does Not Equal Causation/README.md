# Correlation Does Not Equal Causation

This is the repository for the second workshop of the 2021-2022 Academic year, titled "Correlation Does Not Equal Causation". This session went over common exploratory analysis workflows, inferential statistics, and associated best practices. Exploratory analyses and inferential statistics are fundamental to data science, but many people struggle in these realms. This session will work to improve your understanding, teach some best practices, and encourage you to think deeply about your data. This will be a fairly introductory course, but will also be in the style of a review. Some familiarity with data science, statistics, and common analysis approaches is assumed.
